1. Create a Deployment definition
2. Use kubectl to create the deployment on cluster
3. Expose it
4. Access it (use the exposed port!)
5. Delete the service and deployment to shut down

kubectl get pods
kubectl get deployments
kubectl expose pod basicapp-deployment-689979c749-7dbfs --type=NodePort --name basicapp
kubectl get services
